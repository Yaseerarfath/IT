Sir Peter Francis Lewis Bourgeois RA (November 1753 – 8 January 1811) was a British landscape and history painter, and court painter to king George III of the United Kingdom.[1][2] In the late 18th century he became an art dealer and collector in association with Frenchman Noël Desenfans

The film had been in development since 1990 at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, or New Line Cinema at various times, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures as its distributor.</p>

<p style="letter-spacing:5px">Favreau signed on as director, aiming for a naturalistic feel, and he chose to shoot the film primarily in California, rejecting the East Coast setting of the comics to differentiate the film from numerous superhero films set in New York City-esque environments. Filming began in March 2007 and concluded in June.</p>
